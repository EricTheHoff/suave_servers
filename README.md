# Get Your Servers Looking Suave!

I'm building this SPA for primarily two reasons:
1. To provide newer web developers with some boilerplate code they can copy into their own projects for better HTTP status usage.
2. To practice new features that I haven't explored yet, such as light/dark mode toggling, code snippet formatting, and interacting with the navigator.

# To-Do List:
1. Finish populating database with status data.
2. Look into integrating with an API to get random statuses.
3. Implement slide-up animation for closing page modal.
4. Fix Vitest tests after separating App.jsx into components.
